The following SQL query attempts to use a subquery in the FROM clause, which is not supported by all SQL databases.  Some databases (like MySQL) allow it, but others (like SQLite) might produce errors.

```sql
SELECT * FROM (SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE city = 'New York') AS users_ny WHERE id > 10;
```

The problem arises because the subquery `(SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE city = 'New York')` is treated as a table, which may not be properly handled by all SQL engines.  Some databases might fail to optimize this correctly, leading to performance issues, even if it does not immediately result in an error.
